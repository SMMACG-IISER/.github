# Swathi's Multiscale Modelling and Computational Group (SMMACG)
**Advancing Computational Chemistry and Multiscale Modelling**

## Welcome to Swathi's Group 
The activities of our research group are centered on Theoretical Chemistry, with a primary goal of gaining a fundamental understanding of diverse chemical systems and phenomena. We utilize both analytical and computational approaches, drawing on classical and quantum mechanical principles, to achieve this objective. Our research primarily focuses on the following areas:

- **Analytical Modelling of Carbon Nanostructures**
